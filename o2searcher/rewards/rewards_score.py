    test_solution = '''<answer>and</answer><answer>and</answer><answer>- Multimodal learning enhances disease diagnosis and treatment planning by integrating diverse data types such as clinical notes, imaging studies, and laboratory results, leading to more comprehensive and accurate patient assessments.
        - Large language models can analyze and synthesize multimodal data, providing clinicians with deeper insights and more informed decision-making capabilities, thereby improving the accuracy of diagnoses and treatment recommendations.
        - Multimodal learning speeds up the drug discovery process by analyzing vast amounts of scientific literature and clinical trial data, identifying potential treatment candidates more efficiently than traditional methods, which is crucial in precision medicine.
        - Multimodal machine learning in precision health improves prediction accuracy and clinical decision-making by integrating diverse data sources such as imaging, electronic health records (EHR), and genomic data. This helps in detecting and diagnosing conditions like neurodegenerative diseases and cancers.
        - Early fusion techniques help in creating a comprehensive patient profile, improving the detection and diagnosis of conditions like neurodegenerative diseases and cancers.
        - Intermediate fusion involves step-by-step combination of different data features, allowing for more flexible and expressive model architectures, which is particularly useful in integrating EHR and text data, enhancing the ability to capture nuanced clinical information.
        - Late fusion trains separate models for each data source and combines their outputs, providing robustness and interpretability, especially in scenarios where different data types have varying levels of importance or reliability.
